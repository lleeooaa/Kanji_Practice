# Kanji_Practice for JLPT
A little website for you to learn and practice Japanese Kanji everyday. Due to the difficulties in finding some huge and reliable open sources, I used the [wiki](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:JLPT) source. If you find any bugs or mistakes in kanji, please tell me and I will correct them. Let's pass JLPT together!
